MULTICASTING COMMUNICATION:
The basic algorithm works as follows
• We have a leader node (we choose the one that created first) who is
responsible to multicast the messages he receives and send them to
all the other nodes of the group. He also receives requests for new
members and adds them to the group.
• We have slave nodes that receive messages from their application layer
and forward them to the leader, in order to forward to all group. The
slave can also receive a request from a new node to join the group
and that request is also forwarded to the leader. Slaves also receive
messages and views from leader and forward them to their application
layer.
We test the program representing each process with a window. We make
the windows change colour in a random time and they should be sychronized
in order to correctly simulate our system.
